  <h2 class="neon">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Kevin Joshua, an 18-year-old first-year Computer Science & Engineering student
    at Jerusalem College of Engineering. I’m deeply passionate about Cloud Engineering
    and spend most of my time learning, building, and experimenting with AWS services.
    <br><br>
    I’m currently preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and following
    a structured roadmap toward Solutions Architect Associate, Professional, and
    Security Specialty certifications.
    <br><br>
    I strongly believe in practical learning. My projects are focused on real-world
    cloud use cases, scalability, and security rather than just theory.
